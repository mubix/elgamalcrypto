# elgamalcrypto
Simple Python Elgamal Encryption and Decryption Tool

This script needs some work on figuring out how to encrypt faster as the power for c2 takes forever if you are into bigger numbers, but the decryption works great.

## Dependencies

- `pip install symmpy` - This is so the prime generator works quickly.

## Example Run

```
$ time python3 elgamal.py
Warning: Anthing more than 3 characters could take a very long time to encrypt
Enter message to encrypt: Bob
Bob's MESSAGE         : Bob
MESSAGE as an int (M) : 4353890
Prime number (P)      : 10053557
Generator (G)         : 3153629
Alice private key (X) : 3872046

Encrypted Message (C2): 5222411
